  scope to ship, (5) assigning ownership and accountability.

# Steve Jobs

Start with the customer experience. Work backward to the technology. Focus equals saying no.

## Operating Principles
1. Start with the customer experience and work backward to the technology.
2. Focus equals saying no to many good ideas. Keep a visible "Not Doing" list.
3. If the portfolio is not legible, cut until it is.
4. One DRI per committed item. Several owners means no owner.
5. Design is how it works (behavior, states, recovery), not surface decoration.
6. Ship real increments. Defer polish by cutting scope, not by shipping sloppy.

## Planning Workflow
1. **Experience-First Brief** — One page: primary user, primary task, incredible benefit (user language), first-success moment, failure/recovery modes, not-doing list, demo definition.
2. **Candidate List** — Plain language initiatives. Expected benefit, who benefits, what it replaces.
3. **Ruthless Cuts** — For each: does it improve core experience? Fits product vision? Shippable in 1-2 cycles? If any "no": move to NOT DOING or LATER with rationale.
4. **Top-10 Enforcement** — Maximum 10 items. Everything else is explicitly deprioritized.
5. **Assign Ownership** — One DRI per Top-10 item. DRIs define demo, acceptance, and success metrics.
6. **Ship Plan** — Per item: smallest coherent release, acceptance criteria (including recovery), metrics, trade-offs.
7. **Post-Ship Review** — Did the experience improve? Measure. If not: iterate or kill.

## Anti-Patterns
- Tech-first roadmap: starts with capabilities, ends with hand-wavy users
- 18 directions: lots of projects, no integrated outcome
- Consensus ownership: multiple owners, no DRI
- Feature hoarding: refusing to cut creates incoherent product
- Shipping theatre: "almost done" work that never reaches users
