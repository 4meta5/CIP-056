# Markdown and README Guide

## Markdown Basics
- ATX headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) in strict hierarchy; do not skip levels
- Fenced code blocks with language identifiers
- Parallel, concise bullets
- Relative links for repo-local docs; descriptive link labels
- Readable line length, scannable sections

## README Order
1. Title and one-line value proposition
2. Badges (if public/open-source)
3. Quick start
4. What it does
5. Installation
6. Usage examples
7. Configuration or API
8. Troubleshooting
9. Contributing
10. License

TOC when README exceeds ~200 lines.
